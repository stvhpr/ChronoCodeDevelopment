            <h3>Reviewing Flashcards</h3>
            <p>Let’s start the fun! Tap Start on the Start Screen, and you’ll dive straight into the world of microbiology flashcards. Here’s how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be presented with a question.</li>
                <li>Reveal the answer with a simple tap—did you get it right?</li>
                <li>Swipe left to move to the next flashcard or swipe right to revisit the previous one.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can use the Next and Previous buttons at the bottom to move through the deck.</li>
                <li>Focus your study by using the Category Filter at the top to select a specific topic (e.g., Bacteriology, Mycology, Virology). Hone in on what matters most!</li>
            </ul>
